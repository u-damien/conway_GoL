"""
main.py
A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Pygame. The program displays a grid where users can toggle cells between alive (black) and dead (white) states using mouse clicks. The simulation can be started, paused, reset, or advanced by one iteration using keyboard controls.
Modules:
    - pygame: Used for rendering the grid and handling user input.
Global Variables:
    - WINDOW_WIDTH (int): Width of the game window in pixels.
    - WINDOW_HEIGHT (int): Height of the game window in pixels.
    - CELL_SIZE (int): Size of each cell in the grid in pixels.
    - BG_COLOR (tuple): Background color of the grid.
    - screen (pygame.Surface): The main display surface.
    - all_cells (dict): Dictionary mapping cell positions to their pygame.Rect objects.
    - black_cells (dict): Dictionary mapping positions of alive cells to their pygame.Rect objects.
    - iteration_status (bool): Indicates whether the simulation is running.
Functions:
    - drawGrid(): Draws the initial grid and returns a dictionary of cell positions.
    - fill_cell_black(pos): Sets the cell at the given position to alive (black).
    - fill_cell_white(pos): Sets the cell at the given position to dead (white).
    - click_detection(): Handles mouse input for toggling cell states.
    - get_black_cells_neighbors(): Returns a list of all neighbor positions for alive cells.
    - iterate(): Advances the simulation by one generation according to Conway's Game of Life rules.
    - reset(): Resets the simulation, clearing all alive cells.
    - redraw_game_window(): Updates the display and advances the simulation if running.
Controls:
    - Left mouse button: Set cell to alive (black).
    - Right mouse button: Set cell to dead (white).
    - SPACE: Start or pause the simulation.
    - R: Reset the simulation.
    - I: Advance the simulation by one iteration.
    - ESC: Exit the program.

    Advances the state of the Game of Life by one iteration.
    This function evaluates all relevant cells (currently alive and their neighbors)
    to determine which cells should die or be born in the next generation, according to Conway's Game of Life rules:
        - Any live cell with fewer than two or more than three live neighbors dies.
        - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive.
    The function updates the grid by calling `fill_cell_white` for cells that should die and `fill_cell_black` for cells that should be born.
    Assumes the existence of:
        - `black_cells`: a dictionary mapping cell positions to their state.
        - `CELL_SIZE`: the size of each cell.
        - `get_black_cells_neighbors()`: a function returning positions of all relevant cells.
        - `fill_cell_white(cell)`: a function to set a cell to dead.
        - `fill_cell_black(cell)`: a function to set a cell to alive.
